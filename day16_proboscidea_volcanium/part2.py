"""
Idea, inspired by the reddit thread:

Run the simulation from part1, but store all possible (sub) "paths" for 24 minutes and the
total pressure they would release. I.e. also include paths that only open 0, 1, etc. valves.

Now find distinct pairs of paths and add their pressure numbers.

The maximum is the result.
